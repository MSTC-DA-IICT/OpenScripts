### Script Description:
1. `main.py`: This script takes a pdf as an input and converts it into an audiobook.

### How to run the script:
1. Import `main.py` in any python IDE of your choice.
2. You will require two below mentioned packages to run this script:
   1. `pyttsx3`: This package is called _Python Text to Speech_, which converts text to speech.
    2. `PyPDF2`: This package is useful to read PDFs.
    
3. To install above packages run the following commands in the terminal of your IDE:
   1. `pip install pyttsx3`
    2. `pip install PyPDF2`
    
4. Then run the script.
5. Provide the location of the `pdf` which you want to be converted to audiobook.
6. The audiobook of the pdf will then be saved by the name `audiobook.mp3` in the same folder where you have kept the `main.py` file.
